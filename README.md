# Overview

This project offers a C++ method to study graph substructure induced by geometrical frustration. The main consideration for determining emergent sturcture is pseudo-graph entropy and Monte Carlo sampling of complete graph colorings.

Results illustrate probabilistic approach to determine emergence of structure as graph size increases.
